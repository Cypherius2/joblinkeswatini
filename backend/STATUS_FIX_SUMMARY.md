# Job Status Fix - Summary

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**
The frontend was sending `status: 'published'` and `status: 'draft'` but the backend Job model only accepted:
```javascript
enum: ['active', 'paused', 'closed', 'expired']
```

This caused a **400 Bad Request** error:
```
Validation error - status: `published` is not a valid enum value for path `status`.
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated Job Model Enum**
```javascript
// Before:
enum: ['active', 'paused', 'closed', 'expired']

// After:
enum: ['draft', 'published', 'active', 'paused', 'closed', 'expired']
default: 'published'
```

### 2. **Enhanced Job Route Status Handling**
Added smart status validation and mapping:
```javascript
// Handle status mapping and validation
let finalStatus = status || 'published';
const validStatuses = ['draft', 'published', 'active', 'paused', 'closed', 'expired'];

if (!validStatuses.includes(finalStatus)) {
    // Map common aliases
    if (finalStatus === 'live') finalStatus = 'published';
    else if (finalStatus === 'inactive') finalStatus = 'paused';
    else finalStatus = 'published'; // Default fallback
}
```

### 3. **Updated Public Jobs Filtering**
```javascript
// Before: Only showed jobs with deadline >= now
const jobs = await Job.find({ deadline: { $gte: new Date() } })

// After: Shows published/active jobs with deadline >= now
const jobs = await Job.find({ 
    deadline: { $gte: new Date() },
    status: { $in: ['published', 'active'] }
})
```

## ✅ **Status Workflow Now Supports**

### **Draft Jobs** 📝
- ✅ Saved in database but **not visible publicly**
- ✅ Only visible in company's "My Jobs" dashboard
- ✅ Can be edited and published later
- ✅ Perfect for preparing job postings

### **Published Jobs** 🌐
- ✅ **Visible publicly** in job search results
- ✅ Available for job seekers to view and apply
- ✅ Visible in company's "My Jobs" dashboard
- ✅ Full functionality for applications

### **Legacy Statuses** 🔄
- ✅ **Active**: Same as published (backward compatibility)
- ✅ **Paused**: Hidden from public but saved
- ✅ **Closed**: Job no longer accepting applications
- ✅ **Expired**: Past deadline, archived
